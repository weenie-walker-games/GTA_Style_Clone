# Grand Theft Auto_Style Clone
A Grand Theft Auto-style open-world game made by following along with the Jimmy Vegas tutorial series published on YouTube.


## Description of Assets
Game will use C# coding with scripts originally copied from the tutorial vidoes and updated by myself where needed.  Assets will either be ones I created or will not be included in this repository due to licensing requirements.

## Project Status
Most recent video completed is Video 4.  At this point, the player character has been included in the scene with basic controls.  NOTE: Due to licensing requirements, the player asset has not been included in this repository.  The player asset can be found on the Unity Asset Store at https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/contract-killer-29235.
